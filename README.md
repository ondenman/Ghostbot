Established in 1977 by James Callaghan's government, the National Ghost Laboratory is the largest and longest running institution of its kind in the world.

Since its formation, it has catalogued well over 200,000 hauntings and its research has led to such breakthroughs as the spirit camera and the poltergeist de-gausser. As part of its remit, the organisation maintains the National Ghost Register and investigates all new and ongoing hauntings in the UK.

Tweets are posted as and when the NGL receives reports of hauntings. All tweets are genuine and **definitely not generated randomly by a computer.**
